# iMESA_NoiseTests

The purpose of these tests were to determine how accurate the instruments could measure current. Noise tests were performed on the headboard.  Data was collected using the python code and stored in .bin files.  The data was then plotted in Matlab.  

Preliminary Test Results are shown below. 

| Scope | Gain | Input Voltage (mV) | .bin file | Output Graph |
